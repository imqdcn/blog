# Supabase -一个开源免费的后端框架

## 来自官方的描述

一个开源免费的后端框架，firebase的替代品。可以简单理解类似于`headless cms`，但是不仅仅只提供内容，它还集成了服务订阅、即时API，用户身份认证（包括第三方身份认证，比如使用`github`、`Google`等账号实现快速登录和注册）、边缘函数、文件存储等功能。

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative.

Start your project with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings.

## 我的理解

其实可以理解是一个提供API的后端框架，集成了订阅功能、实时存储，用户认证（包括很容易使用第三方的认证）等功能。与strapi类似，但是`strapi`更加侧重于内容。

## Is Supabase similar to strapi？

> 以下来自ChatGPT的回答问题：

Supabase and Strapi share some similarities, but they also have significant differences. Both are tools for building backend services, but they cater to slightly different needs and use cases.

### **Similarities:**

1. **Backend Development**: Both Supabase and Strapi help developers create and manage backends for applications.
2. **Open Source**: Both platforms are open source, allowing developers to contribute to their codebases and deploy them on their own infrastructure if desired.
3. **API Generation**: Both automatically generate APIs based on your data models.

### **Differences:**

1. **Core Technology:**
   - **Supabase**: Built on top of PostgreSQL, providing a real-time database, authentication, storage, and auto-generated RESTful APIs. It includes features like real-time subscriptions, making it ideal for applications requiring live updates.
   - **Strapi**: A headless CMS built with Node.js, offering a flexible content management system. It generates RESTful and GraphQL APIs and focuses on content management, making it suitable for managing and delivering content-rich applications.

2. **Use Case:**
   - **Supabase**: Suitable for applications that need a database with real-time capabilities, authentication, and storage. It's more of a Firebase alternative.
   - **Strapi**: Ideal for applications that need a powerful and customizable content management system, such as blogs, e-commerce sites, and other content-heavy applications.

3. **Authentication:**
   - **Supabase**: Provides a built-in authentication system with support for email/password, social logins, and third-party OAuth providers.
   - **Strapi**: Does not include authentication out of the box but can be extended with plugins or custom code to support various authentication methods.

4. **Real-time Capabilities:**
   - **Supabase**: Offers real-time updates and subscriptions, making it suitable for chat applications, live dashboards, and other use cases where live data is crucial.
   - **Strapi**: Does not provide real-time capabilities natively but can be integrated with other tools or services to achieve similar functionality.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Supabase** is more focused on providing a complete backend solution with database, authentication, and real-time capabilities.
- **Strapi** is focused on being a headless CMS, providing flexible content management and delivery.

Your choice between the two will depend on your specific project requirements. If you need a robust backend with real-time data and built-in authentication, Supabase might be the better choice. If you need a powerful and customizable content management system, Strapi would be more suitable.

## 是否可以使用docker部署

可以自己制作为一个docker镜像，然后部署到自己的服务器中。

Yes, you can deploy Supabase using Docker. Supabase provides a Docker setup that allows you to run the entire stack locally or on your own server. Here are the basic steps to deploy Supabase using Docker:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the Supabase Repository**: Clone the Supabase repository from GitHub.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase
    cd supabase
    ```

3. **Run Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to set up and run the services.

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

   This command will start all the necessary services (PostgreSQL, PostgREST, GoTrue, Realtime, and Kong) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. **Access Supabase**: Once the services are running, you can access the Supabase Dashboard and start using the various features like database, authentication, real-time updates, and storage.

For more detailed instructions and configuration options, you can refer to the official [Supabase GitHub repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) and their [documentation](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/getting-started).
